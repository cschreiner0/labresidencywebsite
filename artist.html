  Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN and currently living in Tacoma, WA, Sophia
  is a queer Jewish artist prodemenantly working in fiber and soft sculpture.
  Through a mix of traditional and modern craft techniques Sophia creates
  objects that examine the function of play. Sophia’s work often questions what
  toys would look like if we were not socialized our assigned gender at birth,
  and visits participants to interact with the work as a way to manifest a
  visual language for comfort and play. With Laboratory Sophia will be creating
  three interactive pieces based off of her project I Am Here For You, where she
  invited friends to interact with her objects as a way to reflect on how their
  relationship to physical touch has changed during the covid pandemic. During
  her residency, Sophia will create three new objects and mail them to
  participants to film themselves interacting with and reflecting on where they
  are at, this point in the pandemic. This interaction of the project will be
  titled 'I Am Still Here'.
