    We are looking for proposals to create remote works for interactive pieces. Sound art, new media/video performances, gestural and ephemeral displays, and other iterations considered. 

    Suggested topics include: survival, pedagogy, futurity, surveillance, decolonization, augmentation, resistance, collective care, craft, joy kinship, transformation, death of capital, etc. All self-identifying queer, trans, and non-binary artists encouraged to apply. Priority given to Black and Queer, trans people of color.
